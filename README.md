*Turning pixels into possibilities.*  

Welcome to my GitHub! I’m passionate about building AI systems that **see**, **understand**, and **create**. My work spans deepfake detection, generative models, and real-time computer vision, with applications in healthcare, media, and autonomous systems.  

---

## 🛠️ **What I Do**  
- **Deepfake Systems**: Detection (GANs, diffusion models) and generation (StyleGAN, First-Order Motion).  
- **Computer Vision**: Object detection (YOLOv8), segmentation (SAM, Mask R-CNN), and image classification.  
- **Generative AI**: Photorealistic image synthesis with GANs, diffusion models, and super-resolution.  
- **Deployment**: Optimizing models for edge devices using TensorRT, ONNX, and Docker.
